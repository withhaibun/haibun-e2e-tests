# haibun end to end tests

* Create always up to date and verified specifications, tests, documentation, video walkthroughs using plain language files
  * Tests use real browser for comprehensive, high fidelity, precise testing
  * End to end tests can be quicker to develop, handle backend changes, and test all services in concert
  * Their plain language level means they aren't tightly bound to any implementation, anyone can read them
* Documentation is always verified and up to date
* Create interactive reviews with artifacts that are versioned to project deployments
* Create demo videos

```cucumber

Ordinary sentences can be used to describe what's happening.

Tests use a behaviour driven approach.

  When I go to the project webpage
  Then I see "Welcome"

  When I click on the About webpage
  Then I see "About the project"
```

Precise, comprehensive tests can also be used to generate new applications for AI assisted coding.


## Test types

* Web page functionality; interact with forms, verify navigation, heuristic accessibility
