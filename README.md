e2e tests are now in the [main haibun repo](https://github.com/withhaibun/haibun).

This is the walkthrough demo.

`cd` to the project directory, then

`npm i` to install libraries

`npm run build` to build

`npm run test` to run all tests, or `npm run test <name>` for one test, for example, `npm run test after-every`.

Take a look at scripts in package.json for more test options, and use `npm run test -- --help`

## Walkthrough

`npm run walkthrough` will create a sample video with audio walkthrough.
